ADR: FocusTasks 6092

Decision 1 — Semantic HTML
Used <header>, <main>, <section>, and <ul> for accessibility. Labels and keyboard focus rings are applied.

Decision 2 — State Handling
A closure-based store encapsulates state and syncs with localStorage, avoiding global mutation.

Decision 3 — Responsiveness
One media query at 481px switches layout from stacked (mobile) to side-by-side (desktop).

Decision 4 — Validation & Escaping
Empty tasks are rejected with an inline error. User input is safely escaped using textContent and escapeHTML() to prevent XSS.

Decision 5 — Event Delegation
One listener on the main wrapper handles all add, toggle, and delete actions efficiently.
